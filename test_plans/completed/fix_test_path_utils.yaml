current_issues:
  - Happy Path Only: No error conditions or edge cases tested
  - Implementation Details: Tests internal path calculation logic
  - Missing Coverage: Helper function _get_base_resource_path not directly tested
  - Excessive Mocking: Uses patch to simulate environments instead of testing actual behavior
  - Limited Scenarios: Only tests 3 basic scenarios, missing many edge cases
