  critical_points:
    - "Always use in-memory databases for isolation"
    - "Never rely on sleep() or timing for synchronization"
    - "Use threading primitives for controlled concurrency"
    - "Each test must be completely independent"
    - "Verify thread cleanup in tearDown"

    - name: "create_in_memory_connection"
      purpose: "Factory for thread-local in-memory SQLite connections"
      
    - name: "synchronized_worker_start"
      purpose: "Start multiple workers with barrier synchronization"
      
    - name: "wait_for_operations"

# Success Criteria
success_criteria:
  - "All tests pass consistently (0% flakiness over 100 runs)"
  - "Tests complete in under 1 second total"
  - "No resource leaks (threads, connections, file handles)"
  - "100% thread cleanup in tearDown"
  - "Clear error messages on assertion failures"
  - "Tests remain valid when DatabaseWorker implementation changes"

# Risk Mitigation
risk_mitigation:
  - risk: "In-memory DB behaves differently than file DB"
    mitigation: "Verify same SQLite version and pragma settings"
    
  - risk: "Thread synchronization adds complexity"
    mitigation: "Use well-documented threading patterns"
    
  - risk: "Tests become too unit-focused and miss integration issues"
    mitigation: "Keep separate integration test file for end-to-end scenarios"
    
  - risk: "Mock complexity obscures test intent"
    mitigation: "Use helper functions to encapsulate mock setup"

# Migration Path
migration_steps:
  1: "Create new test file with proper structure"
  2: "Implement helper functions and fixtures"
  3: "Port existing test cases with fixes"
  4: "Add new test cases for missing coverage"
  5: "Verify no flakiness with repeated runs"
  6: "Delete or deprecate old test file"
  7: "Update CI configuration if needed"

# Documentation Requirements
documentation:
  - "Add docstrings explaining concurrency testing approach"
  - "Document synchronization patterns used"
  - "Explain why in-memory DB is used"
  - "Provide examples of adding new concurrency tests"
  - "Note any SQLite version requirements"
