# Cleaned up test plan for test_transcription_controller.py
# 
# REMOVED ITEMS:
# - All Phase 1 tasks (excessive mocking removal) - these are structural changes, not missing tests
# - All Phase 2 behavior testing tasks - most core behaviors are already tested
# - All Phase 3 structural improvements - test splitting is organizational, not missing functionality  
# - Most Phase 4 error cases - basic error handling is already covered
# - All Phase 5 quality improvements - these are enhancements, not missing tests
#
# The existing test file already covers:
# - Constructor initialization (test_init_successful)
# - File validation (test_validate_inputs_* methods)
# - Configuration handling (test_build_thread_args_* methods)  
# - Signal behavior (multiple tests verify signal emission)
# - Database interaction (test_on_transcription_completed_* methods)
# - Basic error cases (missing files, oversized files, missing API keys)
# - Transcription execution flow (test_start_* methods)
# - Callback handling (test_on_transcription_progress, test_on_transcription_error)
# - Cancellation (test_cancel_* methods)
# - Edge cases (speaker detection formats, whitespace handling)
#

notes:
  - "The existing test suite has good coverage of basic functionality"
  - "Most missing cases are advanced error conditions and edge cases"  
  - "Focus should be on high-priority items that could occur in normal usage"
  - "Many low-priority items are extreme edge cases that may not be worth implementing"
