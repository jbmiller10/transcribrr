# CLEANED TEST PLAN: Database Manager Missing Test Cases
# 
# NOTE: This plan has been significantly reduced after analyzing existing test files.
# The original plan incorrectly assumed that all tests used excessive mocking and
# lacked real database testing. However, the following files already provide
# comprehensive real database testing:
#
# REMOVED (Already Implemented):
# - test_database_manager_behavior.py: Real file-based database testing with behavior focus
# - test_database_worker_integration.py: In-memory SQLite testing with actual database state verification
# - test_database_worker_concurrency.py: Concurrent worker testing with file-based database
# - test_db_utils_unit.py: Comprehensive db_utils testing with in-memory database
# - All basic CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) are tested with real databases
# - Constraint testing (unique constraints, foreign keys) already implemented
# - Transaction integrity and atomic operations already tested
# - Basic error scenarios and invalid SQL handling already covered
# - The "empty test method" mentioned in the plan is actually fully implemented
#
# The main test_database_manager.py file does use extensive mocking, but the behavior
# and integration test files provide the real database testing coverage that was
# supposedly missing.

# Implementation Priority
implementation_notes:
  priority: "These tests would add robustness but are not critical"
  rationale: "Core database functionality is already well-tested with real databases"
  effort_justification: "Only implement if experiencing issues in these specific areas"
  
suggested_approach:
  - "Focus on specific error scenarios you've encountered in production"
  - "Add performance tests only if performance issues are reported"
  - "Consider these as future enhancements rather than critical fixes"

# Overall Assessment
assessment: |
  The original test plan significantly overstated the problems. The codebase already has:
  - Comprehensive real database testing (both in-memory and file-based)
  - Behavior-focused integration tests
  - Concurrency testing with multiple workers
  - Full CRUD operation coverage with state verification
  - Constraint and error handling tests
  
  The remaining gaps are edge cases and specific error scenarios that would enhance
  robustness but are not critical missing functionality.
